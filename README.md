# Python Utility Script

This repo has script written in Python that I used for programatically doing things...

I ran these code in Python v3+ using Ubuntu running under Windows Subsytem for Linux 2 (WSL2). Please note that you will have to download Python and be somewhat familiar with using the command line (Bash, Powershell, etc). Feel free to adapt and use it however you want!
